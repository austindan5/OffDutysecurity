How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

There is not an easy way to find an off duty officer for security in metro Atlanta. This site was built with HTML,CSS, and JavaScript so that visitors can have easy access to reaching out to the business owner. It ulitlizes formspree for the contact form so that the owner can recieve every notification.

Optimizations

I would like to eventually use node to make the form section independent to the site. This way you can still browse the website after you are finished requesting the services.

Lessons Learned:

I loved working with another client trying to help the world be a better place. I really enjoyed trying to make the contact form work in different ways and different ways to complete the task. It was a challenge but I came out better on the other side.

Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
